        <h1>About Cut the Rope Home</h1>
        <p>Cut the Rope Home started as a simple Discord server about modding the original Cut the Rope. Over time, we decided to change our scope, and, while our main focus is still modding, we wanted to give something else to the general community.</p>

        <h2>Who we are</h2>
        <img src="/img/aidrum.png" width="150"/> <img src="/img/susblue.png" width="150"/>
        <p>Cut the Rope Home is made by <a href="https://twitter.com/mushroomfromgd">aidrum</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SusBlue">TheAwesomeBlue</a> as a place to share stuff for the Cut the Rope community.</p>
        <p>We are not affiliated with ZeptoLab or Cut the Rope in any way, shape or form. We simply enjoy the games they have made over the years.</p>

        <p>im <a href="https://judecase17.online">judecase17</a></p> 
        <p>i just own the domain cuttherope.homes</p>
        <p>the original website hosted on github.io is at <a href="https://ctrhome.github.io">Here</a></p>
        <h2>Why we made the site</h2>
        <p>We made this website as a place to have everything a Cut the Rope fan could ever want! Music, app icons, game downloads, and more! We tried to find the optimal version of every game for every (major) platform (No ads, high quality graphics!) and found an extremely obscure version of <a href="/games/cut-the-rope-holiday-gift/">Cut the Rope Holiday Gift</a> in the process.</p>
